# Example: 301 Red vs Blue

The `Red vs Blue` scene demonstrates how one might make actors fight. There are two characters a Red and a Blue. Blue will wander and eat, Red will chase down blue and eat.

IN PROGRESS:

In order to give Actors the desire to attack the enemy we introduce the concept of Experience. Actors get experience by interacting with another Actor.

TODO:

Each actor will actively look for the other. If they cannot see the enemy then they will wander. 

Once they spot an alive enemy they will move towards them and engage in combat.
