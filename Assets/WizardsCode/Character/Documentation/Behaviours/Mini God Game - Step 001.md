In this Mini God Game you are a god. Though not a very powerful one. Your goal is to keep your people happy and alive. There's very little you can do to influence their lives. You can tell them what to do, they have free will.

You can, however, influence the world they live in.

You start out with 2 people in your population. Fortunately, one is male and the other is female. Your first job is to encourage them to build a house. to build a house they will need wood. So plant a few trees.

Simply point and click to plant trees.

The male (red) character will go an chop the trees down. But this takes up alot of energy. When he's tired he will lie down to rest.

When he has enough wood he will build a house and will be able to go to sleep and rest properly.

If his energy levels go too low he will start to loose health. If his health reaches 0 he will die.
