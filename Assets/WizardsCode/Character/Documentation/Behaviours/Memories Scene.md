
If actors have a `MemoryController` component then they will remember things
that happen to them. These memories can influence which behaviours are selected by the brain.

# Example: 211 Eat and Sleep with Memories Behaviour

This simple example is almost the same as the 201 Eat and Sleep scene, the difference is that the actor in this scene has a memory and this will always return to the table to eat when hungry. In the 201 scene the actor wandered aimlessly until they happened upon the table again.
