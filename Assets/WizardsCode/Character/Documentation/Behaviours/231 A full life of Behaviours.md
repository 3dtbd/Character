The `231 A full life of Behaviours` scene seeks to simulate a full life for an avatar. They will go to work, rest, socialize and learn. This builds upong the previous scenes which, so far, have given us eat, sleep and learn. This scene adds work and play.

TODO: Play will increase happiness but decrease cash.
WIP: The name RequiredStates in the behaviours is wrong. It should be called AffectedStates. We likely still need a required state though. For example, Play will affect both happiness and cash. However, the actor must have enough cash while happiness can be any level.

TODO: Work will decrease happiness but increase cash.

TODO: Since we now have cash in the game lets also make learning and eating cost money.
