# Example: Eat, Sleep and Learn Scene

This scene demonstrates how a character can have lower and higher priority desires. As with the earlier Eat and Sleep scenes the character will go about their required daily functions. However, they will also seek knowledge by studying in the library. 

The lowest priority behaviour is the one that comes last in the list of behaviours.
