This scene demonstrates how to give a character emotions. These emotions can then be used to influence animations that play.

This scene currently doesn't demonstrate these emotions well as the character doesn't have animations to demonstrate their impact. It is designed to show how you might control those emotions in gameplay, but there is currently no visual feedback.

For a better understanding of what is possible check out my video describing what happens when this is integrated wth a talking character: https://youtu.be/HnFmDeWkzNQ

Also note that at the time of writing this scene requires UMA to be in your project. We'll remove that dependency at some point ad replace it with the Neo character (patches welcome).
